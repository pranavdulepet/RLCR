## 🛠 Installation

### Environment Setup


```bash
git clone https://github.com/damanimehul/RLCR.git
cd RLCR 
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rl
```
If this build fails, an alternative is to create a conda env from scratch with the correct torch, vllm, transformers, math-verify, datasets, accelerate and deepspeed versions. 

### TRL Installation 

```bash
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git
cd trl/
git checkout 69ad852e5654a77f1695eb4c608906fe0c7e8624
pip install -e .
```

### Login to wandb 

```bash
wandb login
```

### Deepspeed & Accelerate Setup

Ensure `deepspeed` and `accelerate` are properly configured for the available hardware ([guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index)). 
We provide a deepspeed.yaml config for 4 gpus. 

### HuggingFace Models and Data
All models and datasets are available at this [RLCR HuggingFace Collection.](https://huggingface.co/collections/mehuldamani/rlcr-68912f9731b0bce30e4cc8c0)

## 🚀 Training

To run RLCR on hotpot:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 accelerate launch --num_processes 4 --config_file deepspeed.yaml rl_runner.py --config configs/Qwen-7B/hotpot/RLCR.yaml
```

### 📝 Notes

- Wandb logs from reproduced runs available [here](https://wandb.ai/mehuldamani/RLCR?nw=nwusermehuldamani). Intermediate generations are also logged and are useful for debugging. 
- Additional training scripts are available in `train_runs.sh`.
- All training configurations are defined in the `configs/` directory. New configs can be added to support custom training setups.
- **Compute details**:
  - We ran HotpotQA experiments on **4×A100 GPUs**
  - Math experiments were run on **6×A100 GPUs**
  - The **generation batch size** is computed as:
    ```
    generation_batch_size = num_processes × per_device_train_batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps
    ```
    It should be kept **constant or increased** if more compute is available. Lowering it may lead to instability during training.
- **Limitations**:
  - This field is evolving rapidly. We believe that both the **base RL implementation** and **hyperparameter settings** can be further improved. Doing so may reduce some training instabilities we encountered and enhance model calibration and reasoning quality.
  - Learning well-calibrated policies requires exploration over a range of verbalized confidences. If training problems have similar difficulty, the policy may collapse to outputting a narrow band—or even a single—confidence value, hindering calibration. If this behavior is encountered, incentivizing more exploration in verbalized confidence scores through higher temperature/modifications to system prompt can be effective.

We welcome suggestions and contributions!

### 🧪 Sample Evaluation Run

Run evaluation on a dataset using a config:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluation.py --config eval_configs/Hotpot-models/trivia.json
```

For a full eval suite on a single GPU (We already provide the outputs/results from this):

```bash
bash eval_runs.sh
```

### 📝 Notes

- Evaluation outputs get logged to eval_outputs, metrics get logged to results/ . 
- To evaluate on new datasets/models, add them to config files inside `eval_configs/`.
- Default evaluation uses `temperature = 0` and `max_tokens = 4096`.
- Currently supported evaluation functions:
  - **Exact Match** (Used for hotpotqa)
  - **Math Verify** (Used for all math datasets)
  - **LLM-as-a-Judge** (Used for trivia, simpleqa, commonsenseqa, gpqa)
